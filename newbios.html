  <h2>Chris: Drums</h2>
What do you call a guy who hangs out with musicians?  A drummer.  Chris has been drumming since 1989.  He's played with acts like Misdemeanor, The Maverick Marching Machine, Layman's Terms, The Shaw Brothers, Kitty Valentine, Blackwater Alley, Hillbilly Mayhem, South 40, and now recently, Van Rothgar.  Chris is able to play a wide variety of music styles to include rock, country, funk, and rockabilly. Influences include John Bonham, Jeff Shaw, Chad Sexton, Chad Smith, Tim "Herb" Alexander, Brian Setzer, Dominic Howard, Danny Carey, Neil "The Professor" Peart, and of course, The Reverend Alex Van Halen. 
  <h2>Nathan: Guitar/Bass</h2>
After years of being a bedroom guitarist, Nathan felt that he ought to do something with the needlessly vast amount of Van Halen knowledge he gained in college while failing his classes. When the mighty Van Rothgar called upon Nathan, he jumped at the opportunity to continue his devotion to Roth... (gar). When not shreddin' for Ed, Nathan is either skiing or playing guitar in his other band that he co-founded: Pith, in addition to some other bands that are in the works.
 <h2>Tyler: Drums</h2>
While his brother shredded away on Eddie’s solos during college, Tyler, then in high school, took his childhood drum kit out of the attic and started plugging away at Alex Van Halen’s drum parts. Fast forward to now, and Tyler splits time between Minnesota and Boston as an electronic production student at Berklee (he auditioned to the school with “Outta Love Again!”), and has studied drums under the likes of Adam Marcello (Katy Perry) and Dave DiCenso (Gary Cherone, Duran Duran, Josh Groban, etc.).
